<!-- <h1>Welcome to the Tiny Feet GHG Database Reader</h1>
<h2>This app can read all entries for each table in the database.</h2>
<p>This app uses flask and sqlalchemy to connect to our MySQL database using read-only permissions, currently hosted on bluehost</p>
<p>This site uses jinja for template inheritence and for passing python dictionaries of the table rows and columns <br>
     queried from sqlalchemy Object Relational Mapping classes into the html template to be iterated over in a for loop and displayed in html tables</p>
<p>The tables are all queried at the same time, but there is a javascript function that unhides the tables when selected from the drop-down menu</p> -->

  <h4>Project Description</h4>
  <p>The goal of the Tiny Feet Toolkit is to help communities kickstart the Climate Action Plan (CAP) process. A CAP is
    a set of solutions and guidelines communities will follow to help reduce their carbon footprint. The initial phase
    of the standard CAP development process is an assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sources in the
    community, known as an emissions inventory. With the process requiring arduous source data collection and general
    understanding of climate science, the cost to perform this initial step inhibits many communities from pursuing
    climate action. In addition, the time spent performing an emissions inventory delays any environmental improvement
    recognized through action implementation. As a result, the Tiny Feet team created a toolkit for communities to
    access an estimation of their GHG emissions calculated from free public data. The Tiny Feet team encourages
    communities to use the toolkit to help ease their path in creating their CAP.</p>
  <br>
  <p>*Disclaimer* The data displayed is an estimation intended to help user in the initiating their CAP process. The
    information provided by the toolkit is NOT a comprehensive emissions inventory for the selected area. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Why is creating a community Climate Action Plan important in reducing global warming?
    The UN Environment Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) advise that global greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions need to be cut by over half by 2030 in order to keep warming below a 1.5° C threshold, a
    critical tipping point that if exceeded would have catastrophic consequences to all planetary systems. The primary
    source of GHG emissions is the burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity, create heat, and run vehicles. GHG
    are also generated from the decomposition of waste in landfills. Internationally municipalities are committing to
    climate responsibility; in 2019, 77 countries and over 100 cities committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at
    the international Climate Action Summit. Unfortunately, the current commitments by cities and countries to net-zero
    emissions only get us about halfway to the emissions reductions necessary. This means that to best our chances for
    limiting the effects of global warming, CAPs need to increase drastically both in number and in effectivity.
    Simultaneously the effects of climate change and inequity are demanding immediate attention which GHG emissions
    reductions goals alone often fail to prioritize.</p>

  <h4>User Description</h4>
  <p>The toolkit is designed to allow the users to select the county, city, or zip-code of interest within Colorado. The
    data is available in three different views. The first view is a map showing the average GHG emissions per person in
    each municipality. The second view allows users to input their county, city, or zip to display their emissions data
    per sector in chart form. The final view is a table consisting of the full dataset of calculated GHG emissions from
    each sector for a selected county, city, or zip code. The data shows the three major sectors in GHG emissions,
    Energy, Transportation, and Waste. The user can then press the recommendations link to look at a list of solutions
    in decreasing their GHG emissions. The recommendations list can also be filtered by societal co-benefits created by
    particular actions. </p>

  <h4>About Us</h4>
  <p>The Tiny Feet team is a collaboration between Western Colorado University and Colorado School of Mines.</p>
  <p>Valeda Scribner: After 15 years as an aerospace engineer and program manager building, testing, and launching
    satellites, Valeda decided to shift her career focus to contributing to the ever-escalating issue of climate change.
    To expand her knowledge of environmental issues she spent two years travelling and volunteering internationally.
    Eventually she enrolled at Western Colorado University to join their Master of Environmental Management program with
    a focus in Sustainable and Resilient Communities. She assisted Eagle County with emissions forecasting of climate
    actions and updated Park City’s emissions inventory as a part of the Mountain Town 2030 (MT2030) cohort. These
    efforts highlighted the cost, effort duration of a standard GHG emissions inventory and thus the concept of the Tiny
    Feet CAP toolkit emerged.</p>
  <p>The 30 Percent: The team consist of six undergraduate students from the Colorado School of Mines Senior Capstone
    Design. The team is unique as it consists of only female engineers. Within the team, there are three Mechanical
    Engineers, Heather Keniry, April Lyndon, and Kathie Zhang, two Electrical Engineers, Caroline Hidalgo and Gillian
    Yost and an Environmental Engineer, Perla Lyon.</p>
