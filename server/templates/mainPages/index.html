      <h4>Project Description</h4>
      <p>
        The goal of the Tiny Feet Toolkit is to help communities kickstart the
        Climate Action Plan (CAP) process. A CAP is a set of solutions and
        guidelines communities will follow to help reduce their carbon
        footprint. The initial phase of the standard CAP development process is
        an assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sources in the
        community, known as an emissions inventory. With the process requiring
        arduous source data collection and general understanding of climate
        science, the cost to perform this initial step inhibits many communities
        from pursuing climate action. In addition, the time spent performing an
        emissions inventory delays any environmental improvement recognized
        through action implementation. As a result, the Tiny Feet team created a
        toolkit for communities to access an estimation of their GHG emissions
        calculated from free public data. The Tiny Feet team encourages
        communities to use the toolkit to help ease their path in creating their
        CAP.

      <h4>
        Why is creating a community Climate Action Plan important in reducing
        global warming?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The UN Environment Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
        Change (IPCC) advise that global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions need to
        be cut by over half by 2030 in order to keep warming below a 1.5° C
        threshold, a critical tipping point that if exceeded would have
        catastrophic consequences to all planetary systems. The primary source
        of GHG emissions is the burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity,
        create heat, and run vehicles. GHG are also generated from the
        decomposition of waste in landfills. Climate action plans are roadmaps
        that enable communities to reduce their GHG emissions in ways best
        suited to local needs and behaviors.Internationally municipalities are
        committing to climate responsibility; in 2019, 77 countries and over 100
        cities committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the
        international Climate Action Summit. Unfortunately, the current
        commitments by cities and countries to net-zero emissions only get us
        about halfway to the emissions reductions necessary. This means that to
        best our chances for limiting the effects of global warming, CAPs need
        to increase drastically both in number and in effectivity.
        Simultaneously the effects of climate change and inequity are demanding
        immediate attention which GHG emissions reductions goals alone often
        fail to prioritize. <br><br>

      <h4>User Description</h4>
      <p>
        The toolkit is designed to allow the users to select the county, city,
        or zip-code of interest within Colorado. The data is available in three
        different views. The first view is a map showing the average GHG
        emissions per person in each municipality. The second view allows users
        to input their county, city, or zip to display their emissions data per
        sector in chart form. The final view is a table consisting of the full
        dataset of calculated GHG emissions from each sector for a selected
        county, city, or zip code. The data shows the three major sectors in GHG
        emissions, Energy, Transportation, and Waste. The user can then press
        the recommendations link to look at a list of solutions in decreasing
        their GHG emissions. The recommendations list can also be filtered by
        societal co-benefits created by particular actions.

                    After 15 years as an aerospace engineer and program manager
                    building, testing, and launching satellites, Valeda shifted
                    her career focus to contribute to the pressing issue of
                    climate change. She enrolled at Western Colorado University
                    to join their Master of Environmental Management program
                    with a focus in Sustainable and Resilient Communities. She
                    assisted Eagle County with emissions forecasting of climate
                    actions and updated Park City’s emissions inventory. These
                    efforts highlighted the cost, effort duration of a standard
                    GHG emissions inventory and thus the concept of the Tiny
                    Feet CAP toolkit emerged.
